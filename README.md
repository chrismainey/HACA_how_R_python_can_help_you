# HACA 2024 Workshop
## How R and Python can help you

This repository is a working place for building the material for this seminar.  By the time of the workshop, it will act as a central resource, point to various places: guidance, examples shown in workshops, NHS-R and NHS Py.com communities etc.

# Sessions
Please pitch your sessions at both analyst and team managers, talking about why and how using Python and R helps. Try to add example as to where they could use them to make their lives easier.  We should say how coded analysis is a cornerstone of RAP and align it with that, but this is not a session about RAP or even Git/GitHub.

Aim at a level where people know how to work with data, but have not coding expertise or experience.


## R and Python showcase

Several 10 minute presentations on practical uses of R and Python in the NHS, and taking a question or two afterwards.
It would be ideal if you have published your code, and that code is available for other to see or reuse.
It doesn't have to be rocket surgery, but if you've automated spc charts for your board using markdown/quarto, used Python to process/clean some data for upload, built forecasting models, built a prediction model, used a large language model... all of these are very valid.   We could even have two different sessions if there are lot of options.

## R in one hour

+ Using RStudio cloud with environment pre-loaded.
+ Few intro slides, then walking the application of things live in RStudio.
+ What is R and RStudio
+ Base R and R packages as bolt-ons.  Install an R package.
+ Objects: "naming and saving things to use later"
+ Data types: vector, data frames and lists
+ Explore Rstudio, import a csv file using the wizard, then look at the code
+ Tidyverse / dplyr for data manipulation
+ Rearrange some data
+ ggplot for graphics
+ build a plot, improve and iterate
+ Examples of regression, forecasting, statics for confidence intervals, spc, markdown/quarto
